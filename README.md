# Data-Analytics-2020-Tasks

Fiona Lee

This repository contains 4 assignment submissions for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis 2020 module of the Higher Diploma - Data Analytics and Computer Science course.

The four assigments are contained in a single jupyter notebook called 'Task 1-4 Assessment Notebook.ipynb'.  The tasks were worked on in individual notebooks which were amalgamated into a single submission.  The individual notebooks for each task are contained in the repository in the 'Individual Notebooks' folder to preserve the commit history.

The notebook contains the following submissions:

Task 1 - Counts

Python function that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the ist as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. The code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise.

    Input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}

Task 2 - Dicerolls

Python function that simulates rolling dice. The function should take two parameters: the number of dice (k) and the number of times to roll the dice (n). The function should simulate randomly rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. 

    The prescribed user input is: (k=2, n=1000) 
    Sample Output: {2:19,3:50,4:82,5:112,6:135,7:174,8:133,9:114,10:75,11:70,12:36}

Task 3 - Cointoss

Python code that simulates ﬂipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. 

Task 4 - Simpson's Paradox

Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox.


Required Software:
